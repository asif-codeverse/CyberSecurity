# **Unit 4**

## **Q1. Recyclability and Self-Regulation in the Four Orders of Nature**

**(12 Marks)**

### **Recyclability in Nature**

Recyclability means that **materials in nature move in cycles** and are reused again and again without loss.

Examples:

* Water cycle (evaporation → condensation → rain)
* Carbon, oxygen and nitrogen cycles

Because of recyclability, **resources are not exhausted** in nature.

---

### **Self-Regulation in Nature**

Self-regulation means **nature maintains balance by itself** without external control.

Examples:

* Balance between grass, deer and tiger populations
* Natural balance in number of male and female species
* Forests maintaining soil, plants and animals together

---

### **Recyclability and Self-Regulation in Four Orders**

1. **Physical Order**
   Matter undergoes composition and decomposition (water, minerals, soil).

2. **Bio Order**
   Plants grow, decay and return nutrients to soil (seed-based continuity).

3. **Animal Order**
   Animals maintain population balance naturally (breed-based continuity).

4. **Human Order**
   Human beings can live in harmony only through **right understanding and self-regulation** (education-sanskar).

---

* Humans exploit soil, forests and animals
